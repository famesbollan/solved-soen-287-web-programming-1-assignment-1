<h1>Question 3 – Forms (6 pts)</h1>

Create a single page that demonstrates an HTML form used for a rental apartment search site. Keep to the format in figure 3 at the end of the handout. You are free to change the text and choices. No CSS please. (Question 4 will have you practicing with CSS.)




Your page <u>must</u> include:

<ul>

 <li>A title within an <em>h</em> tag which includes your name</li>

 <li>Two parts each within its own <em>fieldset</em> tag and each with its own <em>legend</em> tag: one to contain the renter’s information and one for the renter to enter the type of apartment they are looking for.</li>

 <li>In the <em>Renter’s Information</em> part:

  <ul>

   <li>a <em>numerical</em> <em>input fields</em> to input the number of people who will be living in the apartment.</li>

   <li><em>radio buttons</em> to indicate if there are smokers who will be living in the apartment.</li>

   <li><em>check boxes</em> to indicate what type of pets the renters have. Next to the <em>other</em> option, there must be a <em>text input field</em> for the user to enter the type of pet they have other than cat or dog.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>In the <em>What are you looking for?</em> part:

  <ul>

   <li>give the user at least 5 possible apartment sizes to pick from via <em>check</em> <em>boxes</em> o give the user at least 6 possible location choices to pick from via <em>check</em> <em>boxes</em> o a<em> drop-down list</em> for the user to select the price range they are looking for. Have at least 4 options with one being <em>No price limit</em>.</li>

   <li>give the user at least 5 possible <em>It would be nice to have </em>options to pick from via <em>check</em> <em>boxes</em>.</li>

  </ul></li>

</ul>




Note at this point the form will not do anything when submitted.  (No presentation attributes please.)

Make a copy of your HTML page from question 3 and add the following presentation formatting. All formatting <strong>must</strong> be defined in the <em><u>head</u></em> section of your document.

<ol>

 <li>An image of your choice to the right or left of the top header (When the user clicks on the image it should take them to the URL where the image is from). It might be easier to include this part in a table with 2 columns so that the image is next to the header.</li>

 <li>The background of your page should be any color other than white.</li>

 <li>Each <em>fieldset</em> border color should be different and not black or grey.</li>

 <li>The <em>legend</em> of each <em>fieldset</em> should be the same color as the border of the <em>fieldset</em> it belongs to.</li>

 <li>The background color of each <em>fieldset</em> should be different and other than white.</li>

 <li>The <em>labels</em> in each fieldset should be a lighter version of the border and legend color.</li>
